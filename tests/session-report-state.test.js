/* Item 22 found session-report.js's STATE_COLORS/STATE_LABELS keyed on
 * focused/confused/zoning_out/overloaded — state names the engine has not
 * emitted since the gaze classifier was removed. Before the fix the whole
 * script was CSP-dead (item 21), so the bug was invisible; after item 21
 * made the script run, it became a live failure: the state bar rendered
 * empty, because none of those keys ever matched a real
 * session.stateDurations field.
 *
 * This test derives the valid key set from state-engine.js's own STATES
 * export rather than hard-coding a copy of it here, so a future rename of
 * the engine's vocabulary breaks this test — and therefore the build —
 * instead of silently breaking the page the way this one did. */
