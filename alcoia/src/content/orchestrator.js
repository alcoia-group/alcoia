/* orchestrator.js — the detection pipeline, wired together
 *
 * Owns everything between "a reader did something" and "the policy says this
 * earns an interruption". It creates the reading-signal detectors, the state
 * engine and the interruption budget, and subscribes the one handler that can
 * reach the reader.
 *
 * It does not render. When an interruption is allowed it calls
 * `host.onIntervention()` and takes a boolean back saying whether anything
 * actually reached the screen — the budget is spent only on a yes. That
 * split is deliberate: an offer that bails out downstream must not burn one
 * of the interruptions a reader gets per session.
 *
 * `content.js` keeps the shared mutable state (settings flags, the current
 * paragraph), so this reads them through the `settings` and `host` accessors
 * rather than capturing copies that would go stale the moment the storage
 * listener fires.
