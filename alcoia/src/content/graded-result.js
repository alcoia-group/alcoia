/* graded-result.js — the fixed copy shown for a model-graded verdict (item 43)
 *
 * Shared between question-card.js's floating card and quiz.js's own page so
 * a scenario "unknown" (or any other verdict) reads identically wherever a
 * reader answers a free-text question, and so the "never assert wrong at
 * scenario" wording lives in exactly one place rather than two copies that
 * could drift apart. Pure — returns { className, innerHTML } for the caller
 * to attach to its own DOM node; nothing here touches the document itself,
 * since the floating card and the quiz page each own their own result
 * element differently.
 *
 * Every string below is fixed copy, keyed only off the verdict enum and the
 * level — never off anything the grader wrote itself. The only per-question
 * content interpolated in is `question.span`/`question.explanation`, both
 * the client's own already-validated fields (item 42), run through the same
 * esc()/renderHighlightedExplanation() pipeline the recognition path always
 * used — never the grader's own echoed span.
