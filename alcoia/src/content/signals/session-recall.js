/* session-recall.js — what to ask about at the end
 *
 * Retrieval practice is the one intervention in this product with an actual
 * evidence base behind it, and it works best spaced away from the reading
 * rather than immediately after it. This picks which paragraphs are worth
 * asking about once a session is over.
 *
 * Selection is weighted, not ranked. Asking only about the paragraphs someone
 * struggled with turns the recall into a list of their failures and tells them
 * nothing about what they got right; asking uniformly wastes questions on
 * paragraphs they skimmed past in two seconds. So struggle raises a
 * paragraph's weight substantially without guaranteeing it a slot, and every
 * genuinely-read paragraph keeps a real chance of being picked.
 *
 * Nothing here is submitted anywhere. It produces candidates; the reader
 * chooses whether to answer them.
