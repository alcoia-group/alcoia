/* paragraph-tracker.js — which paragraph is being read, from the viewport alone
 *
 * Why this exists: enterParagraph/leaveParagraph used to be called only from
 * inside onGaze(), so with the camera off — the default — they never fired.
 * No paragraph timing meant no WPM baseline, no speed_mismatch signal and no
 * reading-time expectation. Scroll backtrack was the only signal
 * that worked. This replaces the gaze point with the viewport, which is
 * always available and costs no permission.
 *
 * The active paragraph is the one crossing the reading line: a horizontal band
 * some way down the viewport, roughly where people hold their focus. That is a
 * heuristic, not a measurement, and it is deliberately the only one here — the
 * detectors downstream are what turn it into signals.
 *
 * Optional injected block source (item 30b): a caller may pass opts.blockSource,
 * a function returning `[{ el, words, media }, ...]` in reading order, and scan()
 * uses those blocks instead of querying the DOM. This exists so a non-DOM reading
 * surface (a PDF viewer's own .textLayer-derived paragraph model, wired up in a
 * later item) can drive this same tracker without it knowing anything about PDFs
 * — no PDF-specific code is imported here, and nothing about that wiring lives in
 * this file. When blockSource is omitted, behaviour is byte-for-byte identical to
 * scanning the DOM: same selector, same word-count/media filtering, same index
 * assignment order. `el` for an injected block must implement getBoundingClientRect()
 * (elementAtReadingLine() calls it identically for both paths) and, if the caller
 * wants intervention-policy.js's never-twice-on-the-same-paragraph dedup to work
 * correctly for injected blocks, should also expose .innerText or .textContent
 * returning the block's real text — paragraphKey() in intervention-policy.js reads
 * `el.innerText || el.textContent`, independently of this tracker's own `index`,
 * and that file is unchanged by this item. `words`/`media` are supplied directly
 * by the caller rather than computed here, since word-counting injected text
 * through the DOM-oriented segmentation path would not make sense for every
 * future source. Document-order `index` is still assigned here, sequentially, in
 * whatever order blockSource() returns — scroll-regression.js only needs correctly
 * ordered integers, not DOM identity, so this is sufficient for it regardless of
 * source; supplying blocks in true reading order is the caller's responsibility.

 * time landed on whichever text paragraph was nearest, inflating that
 * paragraph's elapsed reading time and making a reader studying a chart
 * register as "slow on easy text". Tracking them as candidates — with no
 * word-count floor, since most have little or no text — fixes the boundary;
 * `media: true` on the entry is what tells the caller not to run pace maths
